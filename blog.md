After leaving it running over night ( though it was probably not training the whole time), the loss is down to abound 0.1, and it was creating some new messages last night.
Now... to get 3 of them all talking to each other I think, that will garentee they have stuff to talk about.

I didn't let it run overnight tonight, it got a little brok and I was tired.

Loss is fluctuating around  0.51 and 0.09

I want a text model that can help me take notes.
I can cross train these bots by making a bunch of them and getting them in different situations
They all at least have the different perspective of not seeing their own messages.

Make the duck make a reply for a room ignoring the original channel and send it directly to that user as a reply
