Is a human conscious, while a pig is not? Is an ape who can smile at you conscious? Does it have emotions? \n\nWe don't have answers to these questions. We cannot even properly define consciousness. Severe mistreatment, if you will, I will assume as torture. Does it happen just in the lab where there are these laws in place? No, definitely not.\n\nIn slaughterhouses in the US, there have been incident reports, far too many of them, some of which well-documented by NGOs which highlight underlying mistreatment, no, torture, of animals concerned before they are butchered.\n\nNot every single pig and cow is slaughtered under protocol. If you are going to implement laws to protect animals in labs, but not strictly or sufficiently enforce similar laws in places where there is a higher rate of these occurrences, what's the point?\n\"creation of something like semi-conscious human animal hybrids\": I'd like to point this out - just about two or three years ago there has been some research regarding the field of growing human organs in pigs, or some other animals, but it was subsequently blocked on the grounds of 'ethics' because they were afraid that the pigs would become too similar to 'humans' to be considered as some sort of farming tool.\n\nYou have a very valid point, I'd give you that, but you have to understand that consciousness, as I've stated in my previous argument, is extremely poorly defined. Can you imagine the kind of science which we would have today if said experiment and advancement was not blocked? We wouldn't have to resort to other means! \n\nThis is on the grounds of emotional appeal, but if you have a relative which desperately needs, say, a kidney transplant, and this option was blocked as a result of ethics, how would you feel? We have the technology to grow these organs easily, and yet people refuse them on the grounds of ethics.","created":1528112715495,"id":"453162316050071562","server":"381467097030459393"}
