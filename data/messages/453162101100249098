Do you think people with kidney failure will even survive that long to receive one?\n\nSo instead we have a golden option like this some time back, and yet people refused it, saying, oh, its not right, oh, the pigs would become too human to be considered pigs and be harvested. Who decide these things anyway? If you want to argue, I'm not really Homo sapien either, I'm Chinese, and Neanderthal DNA is infused into my blood.\nSo, you have an organ shortage, and you know what's going on? Yeah, organ trade. So now instead of 'sacrificing' animals you have humans who are getting butchered and paid for the organs instead. Boy, doesn't that sound great.\nGranted, if you ask me, between 3D-printed organs or grown ones, I'd definitely choose the former, but back then some of this technology didn't exist (3D-printed organs is still in development).\n\nBecause of the halting research in this field - I can't say for certain that animal-grown organs would be better than 3D printed ones, but surely you can see my point that ethics has potentially killed of a path of great development that could have been ludicrously beneficial to mankind either way.\nAnd because of what? No, not the pigs' pain, no, not because people are concerned about these pigs being mistreated. Pigs are being slaughtered every day. That nice sausage you had for breakfast? Pig. Are people concerned about animal abuse here? No. Instead, they're concerned about something which cannot be quantified, that the pig would become \"too human\" for harvesting.\nEdit: 8 years for single renal transplant.
