It simply showed the hypocrisy of the EU and it's crony politicians, getting immediately triggered when they hear a \"backward\" opinion.\nThe Spanish might be trying to protect its sovereignty... But look at the reaction of the EU on Hungary and Poland trying to protect theirs... The EU doesn't accept their sovereignty. Needless to say that makes the EU and Germany as well as France and Luxembourg hated there.\n\nThat's not what I would consider calling \"ethnic intolerance\", but rather the enforcing of your standards upon others. Or simply put an intolerance against other options.\nThe richer Western European countries(question is for how long will they remain richer) are accepting many more migrants than the eastern bloc... but keep in mind, it is destroy them from the inside. Meanwhile the eastern bloc enjoys one of the top safeties. The protests are mainly aimed against the migrant policy in western europe... Meanwhile in Central Europe the protests are aimed against the right-wing governments... Funnily enough these protests seem to be financed by American and German NGOs while the EU expresses full support for these protesters... while denouncing at any possible time the governments there.\n\nIt is indeed a huge humanitarian disaster... Brought to you by the stupid plans of the EUrocrats. Far less people would attempt to travel to Europe if certain politicians didn't say that they will accept everyone... And didn't finance NGOs literally taxiing them from the coast of Libya to Sicilly.\nI don't know if I am overestimating my country... I probably am, but I am fairly certain that... well without Russia interfering, we will prosper... Actually Poland is already a regional power... of course its inferior to western countries but if the developments continue as they are we could outdo them.","created":1528112679702,"id":"453162165923479564","server":"381467097030459393"}
