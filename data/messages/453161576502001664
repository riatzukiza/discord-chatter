But the thing is, both countries have similar laws banning assisted suicide and euthanasia. So I made a comparison as such.\n\nDavid Goodall wanted to end his life. Sure, he had no terminal illness, but he felt that it was in his best interests, but he wasn't allowed to die in his own country.\n\nCharlie Gard was taken off life support, said decision was not backed up by his parents. The same goes with Alfie Evans. Did they decide if it was in their best interests? No. The parents wanted to keep them on life support. As for Charlie's case, even Donald Trump and the Pope got involved. So how is it that a person who's willing to die denied this right, but someone who cannot give this consent, and parents don't want them to die, give this consent not to die?(edited)\nOh, and for the record, both Evans and Gard have passed on. Goodall has also passed on from euthanasia.","created":1528112539173,"id":"453161576502001664","server":"381467097030459393"}
