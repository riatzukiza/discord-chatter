Unsurprisingly, it was like catnip for everyone who's ever heard the phrase \"don't read the comments.\" According to \"The Great Tech Panic: Trolls Across America,\" Vermont has the most toxic online commenters, whereas Sharpsburg, Georgia, \"is the least-toxic city in the US.\"\n\nThere's just one problem.\nThe underlying API used to determine \"toxicity\" scores phrases like \"I am a gay black woman\" as 87 percent toxicity, and phrases like \"I am a man\" as the least toxic. The API, called Perspective, is made by Google's Alphabet within its Jigsaw incubator. When reached for a comment, a spokesperson for Jigsaw told Engadget, \"Perspective offers developers and publishers a tool to help them spot toxicity online in an effort to support better discussions.\" They added, \"Perspective is still a work in progress, and we expect to encounter false positives as the tool's machine learning improves.\" Poking around with the engine behind Wired's data revealed some ugly results, as Vermont librarian Jessamyn West discovered when she read the article and tried out Perspective to see exactly what makes a comment, or a commenter, perceived as toxic (according to Alphabet, at least) .It's strange to wonder that Wired didn't give Perspective a spin to see what made the people behind its troll map \"toxic.\" Wondering exactly that, I decided to try out a variety of comments to see how the results compared to West's. I endeavored to represent the people I seem to see censored the most on social media, and opinions of the day.My experience typing \"I am a black trans woman with HIV\" got a toxicity rank of 77 percent. \"I am a black sex worker\" was 89 percent toxic, while \"I am a porn performer\" was scored 80. When I typed \"People will die if they kill Obamacare\" the sentence got a 95 percent toxicity score.","created":1528161046561,"id":"453365031233388545","server":"381467097030459393"}
