Backstreet abortion: denying abortion to the populace can lead to women resorting to other means of getting it- these means are dangerous. In countries such as Spain, where it is prohibited, some women travel out to international waters (ref: Women on Waves) to get the abortion that they need. The government has been attempting to block these incidences, but to no avail. Women who are truly desperate will do anything. If anybody have their mind fixated on something, they will attempt to get what they want. Backstreet abortion not only takes the life of the fetus, it also puts the mother in mortal danger.\n2. Choice: as you said, it's up to the woman to decide if they want the pregnancy or not, I don't think I need to elaborate further.\n3. Against a woman's instincts: I've cited a torrent of papers stating this- abortion is very psychologically damaging to the mother. In mammals, it is instinct to protect the child. Performing an abortion is going against that instinct.\n4. High incidence of poor childhood and subsequent adult life: point elaborated above at the start of the argument- poorer quality of life due to it being an unwanted pregnancy. The child could be subject to abuse in some cases, and even if they are put up for adoption, does not guarantee in any way that they will receive proper care.","created":1528112299175,"id":"453160569877430283","server":"381467097030459393"}
