I'd actually say in the case of the Mediterranean... Just do it like Australia, their coast guard doesn't let anyone who isn't supposed to through. Of course Australia is essentially a big island with a significant distance from other islands.\nAnyway, harsh punishment and improved border control will improve the overall situation since people will be scared off of trying this journey(keep in mind that mostly people from Africa try to get to Europe, many \"loose\" their papers or claim to be Syrian). It would also be a good idea to let them know that no european country will accept them(of course this won't work because western europe really wants to destroy itself)","created":1528112450611,"id":"453161205046181904","server":"381467097030459393"}
